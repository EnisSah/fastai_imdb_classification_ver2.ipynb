Basically for training recurrent neural networks (RNNs), it really helps to decrease the momentum a little bit.The right side above is the momentum plot. Every time our learning rate is small, our momentum is high. Why is that? Because as you are learning small learning rate, but you keep going in the same direction, you may as well go faster (higher momentum). But as you are learning high learning rate, but you keep going in the same direction, you may overshoot the target, so momentum should be slowed. This trick can help you train 10 times faster."

Yes, Nolan has created something with his unbelievably, incredibly and god- gifted mind which will blow the minds of the audience away. The world premiere of the movie, directed by Hollywood's most inventive dreamers, was shown in London and has already got top notch reviews worldwide and has scored maximum points! Now the question arises what the movie has that it deserve all this?\n",

        "Dom Cobb(Di Caprio) is an extractor who is paid to invade the dreams of various business tycoons and steal their top secret ideas. Cobb robs forcefully the psyche with practiced skill, though he's increasingly haunted by the memory of his late wife, Mal (Marion Cotillard), who has a nasty habit of showing up in his subconscious and wreaking havoc on his missions. Cobb had been involved so much in his heist work that he had lost his love!\n",

        "But then, as fate had decided, a wealthy business man Saito( Ken Watanabe) hands over the responsibility of dissolving the empire of his business rival Robert Fischer Jr.(Cillian Murphy). But this time his job was not to steal the idea but to plant a new one: 'Inception'\n",

        "Then what happens is the classic heist movie tradition. To carry out the the task, Cobb's 'brainiac' specialists team up again with him, Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), his longtime organizer; Tom Hardy (Eames), a \"forger\" who can shapeshift at will; and Yusuf (Dileep Rao), a powerful sedative supplier.\n",

        "There is only one word to describe the cinematography, the set designs and the special effects, and that is Exceptional! You don't just watch the scenes happening, you feel them. The movie is a real thrill ride. The action scenes are well picturised and the music by Hans Zimmer is electronically haunting. Never, in the runtime of the movie, you will get a chance to move your eyes from the screen to any other object.\n",
        "\n",
        "Leonardo, who is still popularly known for Jack Dawson played by him in Titanic, should be relieved as his role as Dom Cobb will be remembered forever. His performance may or may not fetch him an Oscar but it will be his finest performance till date. The supporting cast too did an extraordinary work. Christopher Nolan, ah! what a man he is. His work is nothing less than a masterpiece and he deserves all the awards in the 'Best Director' category. If \"Inception\" is a metaphysical puzzle, it's also a metaphorical one: It's hard not to draw connections between Cobb's dream-weaving and Nolan's film making, intended to seduce us, mess with our heads and leave an ever-lasting impression.\n",

Already in the future, as he developed this idea in his head, he was visited by another captivating feeling. And what if it were possible to study and manage the place of sleep? Now the British cinematographer is 39 years old, and the world has finally come to the opportunity to get to know what Nolan was so stunning, fast and loud all these years. \"The Beginning\" is a sci-fi thriller about the architecture of the mind. If for some reason this has not yet become a reason for the strongest intrigue, it is never too late to recreate it.\n",
        "\n",
        "Philosophy of Nolan. It is simple and at the same time terrifyingly exceptional. Making your environment think like you. To share all the events happening together. Experiencing the same difficulties. Strive to hold together for the hands to achieve the impossible. Making unusual things happen in the usual way. The topic can be continued, and its brief description will remain unchanged. Any person with whom you work, whether an actor or someone else, will always be completely imbued with the material that you yourself wrote, if this material is perceived by every person at the deepest personal level.\n",

        "Fans of the series \"LOST\" could have done the same thing with \"Star\" as they did with every series of the popular, now in the old days, series. Probably, for a reason, at the end of the day, a percentage of people will be drawn, what from wild ecstasy after watching will obviously lose consciousness in the most positive sense? The name of the film company Nolan \"Syncopy\" from the ancient Greek era means the medical term of fainting, loss of consciousness. I'm not talking about plot similarities with the term. And the logo of his film company, whose foundation happened in the year 99, has absolutely identical design as the \"Start\" screensaver. In the picture, the characters Paige and DiCaprio get acquainted in the same place where Nolan once met his future wife and constant working partner. And this is not all \"Easter eggs\". From the skyscrapers of Tokyo to the snowy peaks of Calgary, from the exoticism of the Moroccan Tangier to the picturesque streets of Paris, from historic London to modern-day Los Angeles. The scale that Nolan saw from the emotional journey of his painting could not fit in a modest framework, so the shooting process affected 4 continents and 6 so different countries.\n",
        "\n",
        "To make the dreams look as real as possible, the director once again followed his eternal principle and tried to maximally abandon computer graphics. Whether it's a revolving corridor 30 meters long built in Cardington, or the busiest street in Paris, mass explosions are caused by nothing else than nitrogen under high pressure. Impressive buildings in the Canadian Calgary provided work for thousands of local residents for six months. Their efforts could not justify themselves fully due to the fact that on approaching the crew to the place of direct filming, for a long time there was not much needed snow. He \"fell out\", creating for the creators is another problem due to the fact that did not stop a very long period. Arriving in early August in Morocco, a big unexpected success for the creators was the acquaintance with the local team, with whose help Hollywood partially took off more than one blockbuster in the territory of this African country. And the street traffic of Los Angeles was cleaned by the railroad train, behind the wheel of which was everyone's favorite Jim Wilkie. The same guy who ran an eighteen wheeled wagon in the \"Dark Knight\". This is only a small part of what the \"Beginning\" shakes.\n",
        "\n",
        "DiCaprio amazes us with one of the most difficult characters of recent times, which is largely due to the care and personal affection that Leo showed to Cobb. Together with Marion Cotillard, they create a screen couple capable of enveloping the soul of any viewer. I've never seen anything like it and close. The talented Hollywood youth in the faces of Page and Gordon-Levitt demonstrate a full understanding of the color range and levels of brightness of the characters assigned to them. Tom Hardy, performing the imitator, brought to the picture a significant share of charisma. And Killian Murphy finally embodied an image that has long been very curious to him. In May 2009, Nolan offered him absolutely any role, and he chose the \"Client\". And Ken Watanabe ... As in the case with the other images, we all will long try to disassemble this character, which is a very important and charismatic question for us. Each of his actors, Nolan asked not to tell anything about the plot, even to their families.\n",
        "\n",
        "Quite symbolic is the fact of the presence in the film of the song of Edith Piaf. After all, for the image of Edith Piaf in the film \"Life in pink\" in 2007, Marion Cotillard received a statuette of Oscar for Best Actress. Hans Zimmer paid close attention to the creation of the track, not so much to the stunning visual component of the picture, but to the emotional world of the main characters. It's always evident when Hans is captured by the storyline of the picture for which he is going to work, and \"Beginning\" is no exception. Filling the rich sensory undercurrent on the screen with a wonderful musical series, Hans did not leave behind his own imagination, allowing himself to go beyond the usual framework in the hope of looking where they would lead him. From here came the guitar, played on which none other than Johnny Marr of the band \"The Smiths\". For any of us, there is a difference in choice, when deciding whether it is worth chasing us for a happy moment or total happiness as such? Also here. Despite the speed with which you develop on the screen a completely different action - you want to keep up with it. Our feelings are awakened in the most active ways because of the resource that causes in us a similar instinct to comprehension and further awareness. This tape is a symbol of the whole structure of our everyday perception of what surrounds us in the material and immaterial world. A symbol that is itself the architect of a bridge connecting two opposite sides.\n",

All this is a combination of the greatest cinematic experience that Nolan dragged through all these years.

        "fifth = (\"\"\"Inception is one of those movies that \"engaged\" film-goers will mistake for genius. Let me explain my theory on people and movies. There are three types of movie-watchers: passive, engaged, and intelligently engaged. Passive people will watch Die Another Day and like it just as much as the Bourne Identity. They don't go to the movies to think, they go to be entertained by cool effects and witty one-liners. Engaged people think they know what they're talking about, and generally love movies that are edgy in plot and execution but conventional enough to understand, like Fight Club and the subject of this review. They believe themselves to be refined in cinema, but, in reality, just don't quite have the intellect, cinematically speaking, to pull it off. Intelligently engaged people will appreciate the complexity of Inception, but also recognize it's a little sloppy, self-serious, over drawn, and empty. They recognize its audacity, but don't pretend like it is Kubrick or Paul Thomas Anderson. Suffice it to say, most people who fall into the engaged category will try and pretend that Inception is a 'masterpiece' and that they know everything about movies. They don't. Inception is clever, but it doesn't rank anything above respectable.\n",
        "\n",
        "The premise is ingenious, and Inception is able to live off its sheer mind-bendiness for the first 45 minutes. Leo is a specialist at entering people's minds through their dreams and extracting, or in this case, planting information. The dream world Nolan creates is so exciting and unpredictable that the audience, me included, couldn't care less about the actual story line. Unfortunately, when the magic wears off and the extravagantly overlong climax starts (almost at the midway point), things fall apart.\n",
        "\n",
        "The first problem is the eventual goal of the whole operation is seriously anti-climactic. As far as I could tell, they're trying to break up some obscure monopolistic multi-national company for a rich CEO, who in turn will give them large sums of money and Leo a way back to his kids. Sound under-developed? It is. Nolan never really fleshes it out. He is too busy creating spectacularly slick effects to get caught up in silly things like crucial plot points.\n",
        "\n",
        "When Inception hits its final profligate culmination (the climax inside the climax), I couldn't help but notice how empty it all was. Nolan makes the mistake of thinking multiple things happening at once equals suspense. In an effort to ratchet up the intensity, Nolan piles on at least 5 simultaneous plot-lines that climax at the same time. All this serves to do is suffocate the little suspense that had been built up. There is literally a fifteen minute stretch where Hans Zimmer's deafening score blares and Nolan annoyingly flips through the parallel actions like an ADD-afflicted friend who can't decide what channel to watch. It's mind- numbing, not to mention confusing as hell. One of these little subplots is particularly ridiculous and consists of a guy running around a snowbound bunker shooting people for the whole 15 minutes. Cutting-edge techno thriller? At this point, I was thinking more along the lines of a Roger Moore Bond flick.\n",
        "\n",
        "For all its structural faults, the single most damning aspect of Inception is its complete lack of heart or emotion. The one remotely human thread in the film deals with Leo and his mysterious dead wife. This thread is drawn out to excess and becomes more and more incomprehensible as the movie progresses. Inception seems to delight in keeping the audience in the dark regarding if Leo's wife is real or just a projection of his subconscious. Inception thinks it's awfully clever, but it's hard to feel emotion towards characters that you're not even sure exist. Near the end, I found the dialog between the unhappy couple completely devoid of meaning, made worse by Nolan attempting to give it resonance through close ups of people crying and a climaxing score.\n",
        "\n",
        "Despite the fact that the majority of this review deals with Inception's shortcomings, I actually like the movie as a whole. For all of its faults, I was grudgingly won over through Inception's pure style and visceral power. Nolan occasionally strikes brilliance, especially in an early scene where a dream explodes around Ellen and Leo in slow-motion virtuosity. This movie is not the genius many will claim, but it's not so bad either. Give it a shot, just don't expect to dream about it afterwards.\"\"\")\n",
